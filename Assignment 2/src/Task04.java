/* Task04 *  * We call Great Numbers those numbers, which equal to the summation of its  * divisors that are less than itself. For example, 6 is a great number, since it is the  * sum of 1, 2, and 3, that are the numbers less than 6 that divide evenly into 6.   * Similarly, 28 is a great number because it is the sum of 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14. Write a  * program that will read an integer from the user and print all the great numbers  * until that integer (including itself). Note that, you must have a boolean method named  * "isGreatNumber" in your class that you use for checking if a number is great. *  * For example, if entering 500, the program should print the following  6  28 496   */import java.util.Scanner;public class Task04 {		public static void main(String[] args) {				// Variable declaration		boolean printedOrNot = false; // Checking whether or not a number has been printed		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);		int input;				// Input		System.out.println("Please enter a number:");		while(true) {			try {				input = sc.nextInt();				sc.close();				break;			} catch (java.util.InputMismatchException e) {				System.out.println("Please enter a valid number");				sc.nextLine();			}		}				// Process		for (int i = 1; i < input; i++) {		// Yes, I could've started from 6, but better not risk.			if (isGreatNumber(i)) {				// If true (...is a great number), print the number				System.out.println(i);			// Prints the number				printedOrNot = true;			}		}		if (!printedOrNot) {			System.out.println("There are no great numbers in that range");		}	}	/** Returns true if the argument n is a great number */	private static boolean isGreatNumber(int n) {		if (n == 1) return false;								// 1 is not a great number		int sum = 1;		for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {			if (n % i == 0) sum = sum + i;						// Determines divisors and sums them		}		if (sum == n) return true;								// If the sum of divisors are equal, it is a great number		return false;											// If all fails, it is not a great number	}}
